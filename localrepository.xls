localrepository: the local repository is a directory on the computer where Maven runs. 
It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released.
Git allows users to perform work on a project from all over the world because of its distributive feature. 
This can be done by cloning the content from the Central repository stored in the GitHub on the userâ€™s local machine. 
This local copy is used to perform operations and test them on the local machine before adding them to the central repository.
